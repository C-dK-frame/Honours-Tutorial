# Multivariate Analysis of Zooplankton Species Counts  

This study investigates differences in zooplankton community composition between two coastal sites: Silverstroom and Ganzekraal.  

By analysing multivariate species count data, we identified patterns in community structure and determine which taxa contribute most to variation between sites.

# Data Collection  

- Species count data were collected at two coastal sites (Silverstroom and Ganzekraal).  
- Data were recorded in spreadsheets and saved as `.xlsx` files.

## Taxa Included  

The following taxa were included in the analysis:

- Isopods  
- Amphipods  
- Nematodes  
- Salps  
- Copepoda  
- Eggs  
- Chaetognaths  
- Polychaetes  
- Crustacean larvae  
- Egg mass  
- Euphausiids  
- Mysids  
- Medusa  
- Mites  

All data represent species count data collected at each site.
Abundance and Species Richness were calculated, however were used in this analysis.


# Data Processing  

Data were imported into R using readxl, cleaned using tidyverse, and analysed using vegan.
Thus all analyses were conducted in **R** using the following packages:
- tidyverse  
- vegan  
- readxl

# Multivariate Analysis  

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to:
1. Identify taxa contributing most strongly to variation  
2. Explore differences in community composition between sites  

# Plotting

A PCA scatterplot was created with:

- PC1 (Principal Component 1) on the x-axis  
- PC2 (Principal Component 2) on the y-axis  
- Points grouped by site (Silverstroom and Ganzekraal)  

This allowed visual comparison of clustering and separation between sites.

## Data Management Plan (DMP)  

### Data Processing and documentation

- All data cleaning and analysis performed in R scripts.  
- No raw data were overwritten during processing.  
- This README file provides project context and workflow description.  
- R scripts are annotated with comments explaining each step.  
- Variable names are clearly defined and consistent across datasets.
